# TODO: Implement Mark as Completed and Progress Dashboard for Roadmap

## Backend Updates
- [x] Update `Backend/src/models/user.model.js`: Add roadmap field to user schema with days array including completion status.
- [x] Add endpoints in `Backend/src/controllers/ai.controller.js`: `markDayComplete` to update completion status, `getRoadmapProgress` to fetch user's roadmap progress.
- [x] Update `Backend/src/routes/ai.route.js`: Add routes for `/mark-day-complete` and `/get-roadmap-progress` with auth middleware.

## Frontend Updates
- [x] Update `Frontend/src/App.jsx`: Add state for roadmap progress, API calls for marking day complete and fetching progress, add new "Progress Dashboard" tab, modify roadmap display to show only days up to the next incomplete day (progressive reveal).
- [x] Update `Frontend/src/App.css`: Add CSS for progress dashboard (e.g., progress bar, completed days list).

## Followup Steps
- [x] Install any missing dependencies if needed.
- [x] Test backend endpoints with Postman.
- [x] Test frontend: Run dev server, generate roadmap, mark days complete, view progress dashboard with progressive reveal.
- [x] Handle edge cases: Invalid day indices, unauthorized access, no roadmap generated yet.
